# ESP8266 Home Alone (Vulnerable Person Monitor)
Monitor that a person is still OK without an intrusive camera

My project to monitor that my mum was OK, by monitoring her general activity / movement, has been running for several months now.

This project uses a Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 to upload data to ThingSpeak, and IoT data storage repository; very easy to use and FREE. In the video I'll show you the graph that is automatically created.

Even better is the Android Phone app that links directly to your ThingSpeak channel and can display the chart in real time. You can customise the chart somewhat and I find this app essential.

I'm going to build V2 very soon and for this I have developed a 4-layer PCB (just about, anyway). It looks lovely in Matt Black, at no extra charge from JLCPCB.com - watch the video to see it!
